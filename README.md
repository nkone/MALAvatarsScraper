# MALAvatarsScraper
Purpose

I wanted to make a waifu tier list from animes I've watched but it takes time to find all the pictures. The idea of this script is to scrape pictures from [MAL](myanimelist.net) from a list of series supplied in anime_list text file. The script will create folder based on the names provided and download avatars from the character page. Granted, the names supplied has to be almost 100% correct otherwise it cannot find the page. Inputting `oregairu` is not supported but its full name will *Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru*.
